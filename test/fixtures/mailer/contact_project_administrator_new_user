Hi,

The new user Aaron Spiggle just signed up and indicated that they are a member of the following projects and/or institutions:

Project: Project X
Project: -pr_name-
New Projects: Another Project
Institution: The Institute
New Institutions: Another Institute

If you know this person is a genuine member of a project you administer, you can add them by:
    - following the link to the project shown below
    - select the Administration menu
    - select the Administer Project members button

Links to these projects are:

    -pr_name- - http://localhost:3000/projects/-pr_id-

New institutions have been suggested - Another Institute. First double check if they exist, and if not you can create them.
You can do this by selecting to create a new institution from the Create menu at the top.

After the institution has been created successfully, you need to assign it to the project following the steps described above.

More details about adding people to projects can be found at https://docs.seek4science.org/help/user-guide/administer-project-members.html
