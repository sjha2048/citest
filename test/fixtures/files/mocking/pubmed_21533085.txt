AB  - The proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha fails to provoke cell death in isolated
      hepatocytes but has been implicated in hepatocyte apoptosis during liver diseases
      associated with chronic inflammation. Recently, we showed that TNFalpha is able
      to sensitize primary murine hepatocytes cultured on collagen to Fas
      ligand-induced apoptosis and presented a mathematical model of the sensitizing
      effect. Here, we analyze how TNFalpha induces apoptosis in combination with the
      transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD). Accumulation of reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) in response to TNFR activation turns out to be critical for
      sustained activation of JNK which then triggers mitochondrial pathway-dependent
      apoptosis. In addition, the amount of JNK is strongly upregulated in a
      ROS-dependent way. In contrast to TNFalpha plus cycloheximide no cFLIP
      degradation is observed suggesting a different apoptosis pathway in which the
      Itch-mediated cFLIP degradation and predominantly caspase-8 activation is not
      involved. Time-resolved data of the respective pro- and antiapoptotic factors are
      obtained and subjected to mathematical modeling. On the basis of these data we
      developed a mathematical model which reproduces the complex interplay regulating 
      the phosphorylation status of JNK and generation of ROS. This model was fully
      integrated with our model of TNFalpha/Fas ligand sensitizing as well as with a
      published NF-kappaB-model. The resulting comprehensive model delivers insight in 
      the dynamical interplay between the TNFalpha and FasL pathways, NF-kappaB and ROS
      and gives an example for successful model integration.
