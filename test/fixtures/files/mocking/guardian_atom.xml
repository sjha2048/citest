A further 15 Tory MPs abstained, meaning that Cameron failed to convince more than half his backbenchers to support the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister ordered the sacking of one parliamentary private secretary, Stewart Jackson, after he spoke against the government. Adam Holloway, PPS to the Europe minister David Lidington, stood down after he too announced that he would vote in favour of the referendum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, who was PPS to the Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson, accused the government of a "catastrophic mismanagement" after imposing a three-line whip on a motion that was drawn from a petition signed by more than 100,000 members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir George Young, the leader of the Commons, said it was time to move on after the referendum motion was defeated overwhelmingly by 483 votes to 111, majority 372. But Tory rebels and loyalists dismissed Young's comments as they pointed out that Cameron only secured a strong victory because Ed Miliband, the  Labour leader, imposed a three-line whip on his MPs. There were 19 Labour rebels and one Liberal Democrat rebel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One loyal Tory, who reluctantly supported the government, warned that Cameron now faces a lengthy battle with his backbenches as the EU embarks on negotiations to reform the governance arrangements of the EU. The senior backbencher said: "This is not going to go away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MP said that backbenchers would test the prime minister on his claim in the Commons  that forthcoming treaty negotiations would give Britain an opportunity to further its national interest. "Let's just see if the prime minister can deliver this great opportunity for Britain. If he can't, there will be another motion on Europe that will be trouble for&amp;nbsp;him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Davis, who faced Cameron in the final round in the 2005 Tory leadership contest, made clear the prime minister would have to give ground on Europe when he defended his decision to vote in favour of a referendum. The former shadow home secretary said: "We have been told this is the wrong time. This is the time when all the claims of Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel are to centralise the EU even more to create a fiscal union. It will have an impact on Britain, as the prime minister has said. So this is absolutely the time to think about this. We should be protecting ourselves from the consequences of the eurozone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downing Street attempted to reach out to the rebels by saying that it respected those who voted in favour of the referendum. A spokesman said: "The House of Commons has clearly voted against this motion. We understand that many people who voted for it felt very strongly - and we respect that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Tories said that Cameron had sanctioned an aggressive operation to persuade wavering MPs to support the government. One MP said: "Dave kept the rebellion under check by launching an industrial scale operation. The message was clear: don't darken my door if you vote against me." One MP is said to have sworn at George Osborne when he tried to persuade her not to rebel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis indicated that there will be an inquest on how Downing Street allowed a petition, designed by No 10 to underpin the Big Society, to turn into such a damaging rebellion. Davis said: "This was not the invention of some faction of the Conservative party. This was asked for by 100,000 members of the public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister met MPs through the day to try to persuade them to vote against an EU referendum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holloway told MPs the only "honest course of action" for him was to resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a theatrical flourish, the former television journalist rose in the Commons to say: "I'm not now prepared to go back on my words to my constituents and I'm really staggered that loyal people like me have actually been put in this position. If Britain's future as an independent country is not a proper matter for a referendum, then I have absolutely no idea what is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holloway, who was quickly followed by Stewart Jackson, PPS to the Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson, emboldened wavering Tory MPs. It is understood that Bob Stewart, a former colonel who was elected MP for Beckenham last year, rebuffed an offer to meet the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson told MPs: "The House of Commons should be allowed a free vote and an unfettered debate on this issue. The government have no mandate to whip the vote, as they have done this evening, because no one has a mandate since all parties effectively reneged on the Lisbon treaty prior to the last general election. "As a former whip I believe this has been a catastrophic mismanagement in terms of my party. We should have been able to show we are mature … Instead we have the heavy-handed whipping we have seen tonight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPs pressed ahead with their rebellion despite warnings from the whips that they would harm their careers if they defied a three-line whip. "Whether they like it or not this will hinder things for them," one government source said of the rebels.Cameron tried to appease Eurosceptics by making clear he was determined to press ahead with repatriating social and employment laws from Brussels. The Tories were forced to abandon their election pledge on this under pressure from the Lib Dems in the coalition negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister said: "I remain firmly committed to … bringing back more powers from Brussels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is understood Downing Street is planning to include a commitment to repatriate these powers in the Conservative manifesto for the next election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No 10 says Britain will push British interests in negotiations over two stages. In the first place there will be limited EU treaty change over the next year to bring into EU law tougher rules overseeing greater fiscal co-ordination among the 17 members of the eurozone. Germany is insisting on a treaty change in this area. The prime minister indicated he was prepared to use Britain's veto in these negotiations to protect Britain's position in the single market and the special position of the City of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Tory backbenchers warned of another rebellion if the PM failed to use these negotiations to repatriate social and employment laws. No 10 believes this can only happen in full-scale treaty renegotiations. But Downing Street sees no sign of this in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fundamental questions are being asked about the future of the Eurozone and therefore the shape of the EU itself," he said. "Opportunities to advance our national interest are clearly becoming apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should focus on how to make the most of this, not pursue a parliamentary process for a multiple choice referendum ... every country can wield a veto until its needs are met."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these negotiations Britain will demand safeguards to protect Britain's position in the single market and guarantees to ensure that the position of the City of London is not jeopardised in a beefed up eurozone. Britain will also want assurances that the 17 eurozone members will not "caucus" – agreeing a policy and then bouncing other members of the EU to sign up. Cameron attempted to underline his Eurosceptic credentials by casting himself in the mould of Thatcher. Praising José Manuel Barroso, the European commission's president for making a strong presentation on jobs at Sunday's EU summit, the prime minister said: "If we want to get Europe's economies moving, to succeed in a competitive world, then these are the steps that are absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are arguments which Margaret Thatcher made to drive through the single market in the first place; and which every prime minister since has tried to push. I am no exception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PM said Eurosceptics had chosen the wrong time to demand a referendum. "It's not the right time, at this moment of economic crisis, to launch legislation that includes an in-out referendum. When your neighbour's house is on fire, your first impulse should be to help him put out the flames, not least to stop the flames reaching your own house. This is not the time to argue about walking away. Not just for their sakes, but for ours. Legislating now for a referendum, including on whether Britain should leave the EU, could cause great uncertainty and could actually damage our prospects of growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rebellion came as a Guardian/ICM poll showed some 70% of voters want a vote on Britain's EU membership. Forty-nine per cent of voters said they would use the referendum to leave the EU, as against 40% who prefer to stay in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy"&gt;Foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/houseofcommons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The NTC official said he would be buried in the same ceremony on Tuesday. Khamis was killed in fighting earlier in the civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the official said Gaddafi's long-time heir apparent Saif al-Islam was in the remote southern desert and set to flee Libya, with the NTC powerless to stop him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's on the triangle of Niger and Algeria. He's south of Ghat, the Ghat area. He was given a false Libyan passport from the area of Murzuq," the official added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Muammar Gaddafi's former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi who, like Saif al-Islam, is wanted by the international criminal court, was involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The region is very, very difficult to monitor and encircle," he said. "The region is a desert region and it has … many, many exit routes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death of the fallen dictator allowed the NTC to spark mass rejoicing by declaring Libya's long-awaited "liberation" on Sunday in Benghazi, the seat of the revolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also highlighted a lack of central control over disparate armed groups, and jockeying for power among local commanders as negotiations begin in earnest to form an interim government that can run free elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/muammar-gaddafi"&gt;Muammar Gaddafi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests"&gt;Arab and Middle East unrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The household savings ratio climbed to 7.4% in the second quarter, up from 5.9% in the first three months of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 9 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;9.37am:&lt;/span&gt; Our Berlin correspondent Helen Pidd has sent us this ahead of the German debate and vote on changes to the EFSF. You might have a sense of déjà vu because the German parliament voted on the EFSF not long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There you were, thinking that with Slovakia finally signing off the EFSF expansion the other week second time lucky, the euro bailout wouldn't have to pass through any more pesky parliaments. Wrong! Angela Merkel has decided to give German MPs another chance to vote on (against?) the package to save Greece and other troubled euro countries from the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday at noon local time (11am London time) she is due to explain to the Bundestag exactly what package she, Sarkozy and the others have cooked up ahead of the crucial summit in Brussels. An hour and a half or so later, MPs are expected to vote once again on the measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merkel didn't want to have to bother with this, of course. Just a few days ago she pooh-poohed demands from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens for this very opportunity. But then parliamentarians from her own coalition had demanded the right to pore over the deal, with many unhappy at plans to "leverage" the €440bn bailout fund up to a trillion and beyond. Mindful of a &lt;a href="ttp://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/sep/07/european-markets-german-court-greek-bailout"&gt;constitutional court judgement&lt;/a&gt; in September which ruled the German parliament must be given chance to scrutinise "cases of large expenditures", Merkel finally agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's FT says the German chancellor is "risking once again a rebellion by a hostile minority in its own ranks - and not simply leave it to be approved behind closed doors by the budget committee, where she has a safe majority." Indeed Merkel's chief spokesman,&lt;br /&gt;Steffen Seibert, told reporters in Berlin on Monday that "this is new territory" and the outcome uncertain. It will certainly be a nervous wait for other European leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But German media seem sure the chancellor would not have allowed yet another vote if she was not sure she would win the so-called "chancellor's majority", ie without relying on help from the opposition. In the last such vote in September - on beefing up the powers of the EFSF - 15 coalition MPs rebelled, and they are likely to do so again. But she can afford up to 19 rebellions within her own ranks without needing a helping hand from the SPD, Green or Left parties to pass the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klaus-Peter Flosbach, an MP from Merkel's Christian Democratic party (CDU) and financial expert who is one of the few parliamentarians who actually understands all of this stuff, is confident. "I'm in no doubt that the chancellor majority will hold," he told Handelsblatt Online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merkel might not have wanted the hassle of another vote – and yet more column inches about her shaky coalition – but, ever resourceful, she may well use the situation to her advantage. Now, whenever other leaders are pushing for even more radical and costly solutions to the crisis, she can pull out the "ok, but I will have to put this to the Bundestag" card. Given the need for speed, her adversaries may in the future be more likely to agree to compromise rather than wait for the Bundestag to battle it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 8 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;9.27am:&lt;/span&gt; Paul Donovan at UBS has &lt;a href="http://streamstudio.world-television.com/CCUIv3/frameset.aspx?ticket=203-933-9258&amp;target=en-default-&amp;status=ondemand&amp;browser=ns-0-0-0-10-0&amp;stream=flash-audio-32"&gt;posted his latest podcast&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market talk suggests that the haircut on Greek debt (rather than extending maturity etc) may be larger than first thought. The private sector was always going to have to take a larger burden, but at some point larger haircuts mean larger bank recapitalisations, which may mean larger public sector costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 7 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;8.51am:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Here is today's agenda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Spanish bond auction at 9.30am&lt;br /&gt;• Bank of England governor Mervyn King and deputy governor Charlie Bean will be questioned by the Treasury Select Committee about quantitative easing at 9.45am&lt;br /&gt;• House of Lords to quiz Mark Hoban on the eurozone crisis and whether the UK should help at 10.45am&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All times are London local.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 6 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;8.48am:&lt;/span&gt; And here is the intro to the troika's report on Greece, dated 21 October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the fourth review, the situation in Greece has taken a turn for the worse, with the economy increasingly adjusting through recession and related wage-price channels, rather than through structural reform driven increases in productivity. The authorities have also struggled to meet their policy commitments against these headwinds. For the purpose of the debt sustainability assessment, a revised baseline has been specified, which takes into account the implications of these developments for future growth and for likely policy outcomes. It has been extended through 2030 to fully capture long term growth dynamics, and possible financing implications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assessment shows that debt will remain high for the entire forecast horizon. While it &lt;br /&gt;would decline at a slow rate given heavy official support at low interest rates (through the &lt;br /&gt;EFSF as agreed at the July 21 Summit), this trajectory is not robust to a range of shocks. &lt;br /&gt;Making debt sustainable will require an ambitious combination of official support and &lt;br /&gt;private sector involvement. Even with much stronger PSI, large official sector support &lt;br /&gt;would be needed for an extended period. In this sense, ultimately sustainability depends on the strength of the official sector commitment to Greece.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 5 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;8.45am:&lt;/span&gt; Our man in Brussels, David Gow, has looked at the troika's report on Greek debt sustainability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "strictly confidential" report on Greek debt sustainability, finalised four days ago and leaked a few hours later, was drawn up by the "troika" inspectors from the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF. It sent shock waves through the markets by spelling out starkly that, with the Greek economy deteriorating far more than anybody had imagined, private creditors would have to accept "haircut" or losses on their holdings of up to 60%. That is almost three times the level agreed voluntarily by the IIF acting on behalf of banks in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josef Ackermann, IIF chairman, and Charles Dellara, its chief negotiator, have been locked in talks in the Berlaymont, the EC headquarters, for days with troika officials led by Vittorio Grilli, Italian treasury chief who will now run the eurozone working group of officials, and the likes of Jorg Asmussen, Germany's deputy finance minister now on the ECB governing council. On Monday night Dellara said the scale of the write-downs demanded by the EU, i.e. Germany, amounted to default and a 60% cut in the face value of the bonds meant even bigger writedowns for bondholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The troika report, highlighting a 5.5% contraction in the Greek economy this year and the prospect, in a worst case scenario, that Greece would need to tap €250-450bn of funds or the entire EFSF, is a gun held to the head of bondholders. It says: voluntarily surrender bigger haircuts or trigger a disorderly default ("credit event") a la Lehman Bros. This now the KEY item on the negotiating table as eurozone leaders seek a three-pronged package - bank recapitalisation, enhanced EFSF firepower and haircuts - on Wednesday night/Thursday morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 4 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;8.40am:&lt;/span&gt; On the corporate front, Swiss banking giant UBS has reported a better-than-expected net profit for the third quarter but warned that the tough trading conditions that hit its investment bank looked set to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its core wealth management business has held up well despite the trading scandal announced in mid-September which cost the bank SFr1.8bn. A big accounting gain booked in the third quarter offset that loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 3 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;8.39am:&lt;/span&gt; The FTSE has ventured into positive territory, trading up 7 points at 5555. Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital, says: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="quoted"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An undecided start for the FTSE this morning as it began the session trading between positive and negative territory. Outperformance is coming from companies reporting third quarter earnings, which have so far come in better than the market expected. But all eyes and ears will be on Europe as investors await further clarification on solving the debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- Block 2 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;8.22am:&lt;/span&gt; Well the FTSE is down 11 points at 5537, a 0.2% fall. The Dax in Frankfurt has lost 22 points, or 0.4% while the CAC in Paris has also shed 22 points or 0.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Block 1 --&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="timestamp"&gt;7.40am:&lt;/span&gt; Good morning. After two days of stock market gains, European shares are expected to fall back today as investors take profits. All eyes are on Wednesday's EU summit where European leaders will haggle over the size of losses Greek bond holders will have to take. Private creditors have apparently been asked to take a writedown of up to 60% on Greek government bonds but banks have balked at this figure, pushing for a 40% haircut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to uncertainty, German lawmakers secured a full parliamentary vote on any changes to the €440bn eurozone rescue fund, which could risk delaying Europe's response to the debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Sudaria, night dealer at London Capital Group, told Reuters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="quoted"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectations for this Wednesday's summit are high and anything other than a 'comprehensive plan' will be a disappointment. Merkel must face down rebels in her domestic parliament once more to gain approval to increase the EFSF. Tensions are also mounting between banking representatives and policy makers over the level of haircut required on Greek debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also growing concerns over Italy's ability to push through reforms, after an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss pension reforms ended without any decisions taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial spreadbetters expect Britain's FTSE 100 to open down 19 to 23 points, or as much as 0.4%. It closed nearly 60 points, or 1% higher, at 5548.06 on Monday. They're calling Germany's DAX 16 to 20 points lower, or 0.3%, and France's CAC 12 to 14 points down, or 0.4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian markets were mixed overnight. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.9% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5%.

The budgets for these projects will be more than halved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universities will fare the next worst with a 40% cut, although this will be offset by higher tuition fees of up to £9,000. The education of 16 to 19-year-olds and the under-fives will each suffer a 20% funding fall in real terms, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of schools will see a real-term budget reduction over the next four years, the researchers said, although those with the most deprived pupils will see a real-term increase in state funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IFS study found that, since the late 1990s, education spending had risen "substantially". While Labour was in power, public spending on education moved from universities towards schools, the under-fives and further education, the study shows. The number of teachers grew by 12% while the number of teaching assistants more than tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke Sibieta, senior research economist at the IFS and co-author of the study, said the UK's education budget was set for a "historically large fall over the next few years".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest challenges lie ahead for the early years, youth services and 16-19 education, where spending is set to fall by around 20% in real terms," he said. "The key question is what these cuts in financial resources will mean for the outputs of the education system, such as young people's exam results or earnings potential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a spokesman for the Department for Education said the government was increasing the budget for schools and said that funds for building works were now higher than they were on average between 1997-98 and 2004-05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the schools budget was increasing by £3.6bn over the next four years and the pupil premium – the £488 given to schools for each pupil eligible for free school meals – would rise over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the provision of free early learning, he said: "We've increased the free entitlement to 15 hours per week for all three and four-year-olds from last September – and are now extending this to all disadvantaged two-year olds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said government was "right to look at the amount of money spent on school buildings. An independent review showed taxpayers money was being wasted on red tape and consultants, not on building schools. Our new plans will build schools cheaper and quicker than before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-finance"&gt;Public finance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/colleges"&gt;Colleges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/further-education"&gt;Further education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education"&gt;Higher education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition"&gt;Liberal-Conservative coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jessicashepherd"&gt;Jessica Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

James Murdoch received the largest vote against his re-election at 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James, 38, faces a second grilling in the Parliament next month over phone-hacking at The News of The World, one of News Corp's UK newspapers. Some 34% of shareholders voted against Lachlan Murdoch 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After subtracting the shares controlled by Rupert Murdoch, 67% of the votes went against James Murdoch and 64% against Lachlan, said Julie Tanner, assistant director of News Corp investor Christian Brothers Investment Services (CBIS), who last week called for Rupert Murdoch to step down as chairman after the "extraordinary scandals" at the company. "Shareholders are saying loud and clear that this board has failed as a group," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive officer, proved far more popular with investors, receiving 86% of votes, although a sizeable number of shareholders, representing 12 million votes, abstained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The votes are a particular embarrassment as Murdoch went into the meeting with at least 47% of voting shares on his side, thanks to the family's control of the company's voting shares and the support of their largest outside shareholder, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Murdoch's controlling share interest the company defeated attempts to throw the Murdochs and others off the board from major shareholders including the giant Californian pension funds CalPERS and CalSTRS, the Church of England and Hermes, the BT pension fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combative Murdoch faced hostile shareholders at the company's meeting in Los Angeles on Friday and said News Corp was dealing with the situation. While he acknowledged the seriousness of the hacking scandal Murdoch described attacks on News Corp as "unfair" and said the company was the "stuff of legend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholder critics called for the Murdochs to step down at the meeting and criticised the pay deals of the company's top executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm delayed releasing the results of the ballot until late Monday. Father Seamus Finn of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, who attended the meeting, said: "The vote clearly demonstrates a profound lack of confidence in this company's leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Les Hinton, former chairman of News International, which runs the company's UK newspapers, had defended James Murdoch saying he saw no reason why he should resign his position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Wolff, Murdoch biographer and author of The Man Who Owns the News, said it was now inevitable that James Murdoch would leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"James will probably go by himself, that's what everybody will be waiting for. I wonder too if Lachlan will step off the board. But could this drag on for another year? Yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff said the size of the vote against Murdoch's son had created "a very difficult family moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief operating officer Chase Carey received strong support from the company's shareholders, garnering 91% of the votes cast. Former New York city school Chancellor Joel Klein collected 96% of the votes cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie Bancroft, scion of the family that sold Dow Jones to News Corp, also received a huge vote against, as shareholders called for greater independence on the News Corp board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanner said the votes against the Murdoch sons and Bancroft showed shareholders were serious about wanting more independence at News Corp. "The overwhelming influence of the Murdoch family is not acceptable anymore," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/news-corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/phone-hacking"&gt;Phone hacking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediabusiness"&gt;Media business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pressandpublishing"&gt;Newspapers &amp; magazines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers"&gt;Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominic-rushe"&gt;Dominic Rushe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

as he revealed a boost to third-quarter profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP reported profit of $5.14bn (£3.2bn) for the three months to September, compared with $1.8bn in the same period last year when BP was hit by heavy charges for cleaning up the Gulf spillage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP said oil production over the quarter fell by 12% to 3.32m barrels due to the suspension of production in the Gulf, though BP expects production to be higher in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dudley has been under pressure following the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/may/17/bp-rosneft-deal-collapses?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;collapse of a deal with Russian group Rosneft&lt;/a&gt; to explore in the Arctic region, but today unveiled an increase in the company's asset sale programme from $30bn to $45bn .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dudley said he expected BP's cashflow to grow by around 50% by 2014 – meaning greater returns for shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jul/25/bob-dudley-profile-bp-ceo?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;The American, brought in to replace Tony Hayward in the wake of the crisis&lt;/a&gt;, said the extra cash would enable it to double its spending on new exploration and to increase its investment in its deep water operations, its giant fields and building its gas operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group's payments into the Gulf of Mexico Trust Fund will end in 2012 and will provide half of the increase in cashflow, he added, while 17 new projects are due to come on stream over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group has restarted operations in the Gulf and last week received approval for an exploration plan for the Kaskida field in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cashflow forecast assumes oil prices of $100 per barrel, compared with an average of $112 so far this year, though lower production and higher maintenance activity and costs offset the benefit of higher prices in the latest quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the nine months to September, BP posted profits of $15.9bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company has steadied, turned round and now, this month, with high-margin assets returning on stream, we have reached a clear turning point," Dudley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that BP had lived up to its commitments in the Gulf and was putting "safety and risk management at the absolute heart of our business".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares rose 3% after the update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left;

Ford, who is back in Washington after leaving Damascus at the weekend, angered the Syrian government by aligning himself with Arab spring protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defying a travel ban on diplomats travelling outside Syria's capital, he regularly spoke to leaders of the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. Unconventional by&amp;nbsp;US diplomatic standards in his outspokenness, Ford communicated directly with the protesters through Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tit-for-tat withdrawals add to tensions between Damascus and Washington, which has called on Assad to stop using violence against peaceful protesters and step down from power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US state department stressed that Ford's return home did not amount to a formal breakdown in relations and that  his deputy, Haynes Mahoney, would remain in Damascus to carry out his duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Toner, a state department spokesman, said: "Ambassador Robert Ford was brought back to Washington as a result of credible threats against his personal safety in Syria. At this point, we can't say when he will return to Syria. It will depend on our assessment of Syrian regime-led incitement and the security situation on the ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A US embassy official in Damascus said: "Ambassador Ford's presence is a benefit to our mission in Syria as he has worked diligently to deliver our message and be our eyes on the ground. This decision was based solely on the need to ensure his safety, a matter we take extremely seriously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an immediate response, the Syrian ambassador Imad Moustapha promptly left the US, said Roua Shurbaji, a Syrian embassy spokeswoman. She told the Associated Press no other steps were being taken by the embassy and declined to comment on the US allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington-Damascus relations have been strained for decades with the US listing Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism. Barack Obama, on becoming president in January 2009, made various peace overtures to Assad, but has given up in the face of the violent crackdown on protesters in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford had been in the job less than a year. The US had recalled its ambassador to Syria in 2005 in protest against the alleged involvement of Damascus in the assassination of the Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri. Ford's arrival in Damascus in January coincided with the US push to improve relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the protests began a few months later and relations with the US have worsened as Assad opted for a violent crackdown on protesters. Ford has established himself as outspoken in support of the protesters. Accompanied by the French ambassador, he was greeted with olive branches and roses by cheering protesters in July when he made an unscheduled visit to Hama, the centre of the revolt,  angering the Syrian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, his convoy was targeted by pro-government mob in Damascus as he headed for a meeting with Hassan Abdul-Azim, head of the outlawed Arab Socialist Democratic Union. The office where the two met was also attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US officials at the time said embassy vehicles were seriously damaged but Ford was unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford has advocated non-violent protest, arguing that taking up arms could lead to the kind of sectarian mass killings seen in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote on Facebook last month: "This isn't about Western military intervention. This isn't about oil (many governments have banned its import). This isn't about Israel or the West wanting to dominate the Arab world (an old, discredited government line). This is about basic political freedoms from the United Nations' human rights charter – signed by Syria, don't forget – which calls for freedom of speech and freedom of peaceful assembly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford has been repeatedly criticised by Syria's state-run media. The decision to leave on Saturday came after the appearance of more articles critical of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation has grown since the death of the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi last week that Syria might be the next target for western intervention, though Obama administration officials deny it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, in media interviews on Sunday, said that while the US strongly supports the Syrian opposition, there had been, unlike Libya, no request by it for outside intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle East analysts argue that Syria would be a more difficult country for military intervention because of the danger of civil war and sectarian violence. There is also nervousness in Washington over whether unrest in Syria could have a knock-on effect on Israeli security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a speech in Jordan on Sunday, Senator John McCain, one of the Republican's leading foreign affairs specialists, said there were growing calls from the opposition in Syria for some kind of foreign military intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCain added: "Now that military operations in Libya are ending, there will be renewed focus on what practical military options might be considered to protect civilian lives in Syria. The Assad regime should not assume that it can get away with mass murder. Gaddafi made that mistake, and it cost him everything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration initially resisted intervention in Libya until faced with the prospect of human rights abuses on a massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US vice-president, Joe Biden, last week triggered speculation by saying that the military model used in Libya – US air power in support of rebels on the ground backed by French and British special forces – could be used elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests"&gt;Arab and Middle East unrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bashar-al-assad"&gt;Bashar Al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill"&gt;Ewen MacAskill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It's something that we were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We already have our ideas about the government. We are not dogmatic; we are highly pragmatic. It will be a broad national unity government. The new reality is that we have to do what we do for the Tunisian people – we go beyond old lines of argument or disagreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  217-seat assembly has a specific role: to rewrite the constitution and set the date for parliamentary elections in a year's time. It will also form a caretaker government. Aproportional representation system meant regardless of the number of votes, no one party could take anan overall majority. An-Nahda  is expected to form an alliance with the centrist secularist Ettakatol party, which is forecast to win 15-20% of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party's leader, Dr Mustapha Ben Jafaar, was banned from running for president under the old regime. He could now become interim president with an Islamist prime minister and key ministers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centre-left Congress for the Republic Party, led by human rights campaigner Moncef Marzouki, also did well. The centrist PDP, once the major opposition, suffered  by association with the old system and performed poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kais Nigrou, of the the Modernist Democratic Pole, a coalition of the centre-left which ran a secular, feminist campaign to counter An-Nahda, said: "We accept the democratic result and we'll be in opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The diversity and openness of civil secular society in Tunisia is strong and isn't going to change. We don't see a threat from Islamists. If 40% voted for Islamists, 60% of society did not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An An-Nahda win would be the first Islamist election success in the Arab world since Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian vote. Islamists won a 1991 election in Algeria, Tunisia's neighbour, but the army annulled the result, provoking years of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/tunisian-elections-2011"&gt;Tunisian elections 2011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/angeliquechrisafis"&gt;Angelique Chrisafis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It said &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kenyaredcross" title=""&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that one person had been killed and another eight had been taken to Kenyatta national hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Njoroge Ndirangu, Nairobi's provincial commissioner, said the grenade blast wounded 18 people, eight critically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elias Ndungu, who witnessed the attack told Reuters: "There was an explosion but I thought it was a tyre burst. When I looked around I saw about eight or nine bodies. One was bleeding from his neck. He clearly had breathing problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Ndungu Kiarie, 35, said he heard the second explosion while in his car and saw people rushing toward him. Many people were wounded in the legs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks, which have not yet been linked, have raised fears of reprisals from Islamist groups for Kenya's support in fighting al-Shabaab Islamists in neighbouring Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somali Islamist rebels &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/17/somali-islamists-threaten-kenya-attack" title=""&gt;warned last week&lt;/a&gt; that they would bring the "flames of war" to Nairobi after Kenyan forces mounted a cross-border land and air assault. The US embassy in Kenya also warned two days ago of an imminent attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kenyan military operation, which began in mid-October, follows the kidnap of four European women by Somali gunmen and has seen incursions into Somalia by Kenyan troops. France said on Monday that it would also assist the Kenyan operation by ferrying in supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenyan police said they were investigating the Nairobi blasts but there is debate over who may be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathew Iteere, the Kenyan police commissioner, said there was no firm link between the two blasts and Somalia's al-Shabaab rebels, who have been linked to al-Qaida and have carried out suicide bomb attacks in the Somalian capital Mogadishu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Nairobi-based security official told the Associated Press that while al-Shabaab had bombing "down to a fine art", throwing grenades was not their style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that grenades have been used on targets in downtown Nairobi. A similar grenade was used in an attack which killed one person at a bus station in December 2010. Six people were also killed in a grenade attack at a political rally in June 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/joadetunji"&gt;Jo Adetunji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Gove has &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/nov/10/jamie-oliver-school-meal" title=""&gt;ended the school lunch grant&lt;/a&gt; as a separate source of funding and &lt;a href="http://services.parliament.uk/hansard/Commons/ByDate/20100707/writtenanswers/part012.html" title=""&gt;exempted academies from the nutritional standards&lt;/a&gt; for all other state schools that Labour introduced after Oliver's programmes highlighted the poor quality of much school food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver said: "Honestly, I'm very worried. I've had a couple of very cordial, interesting meetings with the secretary of state for education and although I would love to believe that Mr Gove has school food high on his agenda, I've not heard anything so far worth celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm sure he realises that there are clear benefits to having good food in school: it improves a child's behaviour, willingness to learn and concentration at school, and that in turn helps children to achieve more and perform better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You would have to be an idiot to ignore all of the academic research that's been published to support these things, but still I don't see him or his ministerial colleagues in health actually doing anything to ensure that the improvements we have made over the last six years remain in place and are built upon – instead the progress we've made seems to be at risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver added: "I used to have similar rants about the previous government so I'm absolutely not siding with one political party. In my experience forward-thinking politicians are a rare breed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if the government's decisions were due to the spending squeeze or ideology, Oliver replied: "I think it's a bit of both but as anyone in this area knows, we have to invest now so that we don't cripple the NHS or destroy the health of our kids later on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given obesity already costs the NHS an estimated £4bn a year, Oliver added, "we simply can't afford to cut costs in prevention work now because we will have an even bigger bill in the future. It's like any business: you have to invest in the short term to see a longer-term benefit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new eight-point action plan for extending schools' influence over children's eating habits and knowledge of food, Oliver asks ministers to apply the nutritional standards to all schools and says "it would be incredibly disappointing and counterproductive not to make them mandatory for new academies too". Academies currently teach almost 1.2 million pupils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manifesto says: "If the government wants all schools to become academies in the long term, the reality is we risk losing the legislation that has made a difference as well as the benefits gained from raising nutritional standards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver also suggests introducing a new school food premium, which would give schools direct payments for increasing the number of pupils having school lunches. About 3 million of England's 7 million primary and secondary pupils eat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Powell of the Children's Food Campaign said: "We are unhappy that the school lunch grant has been amalgamated into the overall education budget because it means schools can spend it on anything they like, rather than increasing uptake of school meals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Judy Hargadon, chief executive of the School Food Trust (SFT), which helps schools improve take-up of meals, said she feared Oliver's idea could demotivate schools that faced the toughest task in persuading pupils to use the canteen regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Education (DfE) released a letter Gove wrote to Oliver in August after they met, in which he said "I very much share your views about the importance of providing children and young people with healthy school food and about the benefits this brings", and promised "the government will continue to support and encourage schools to this end and support the improvements that have been achieved in recent years in schools food provision and food education".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted "with interest" the school food premium idea and has asked DfE officials "to discuss with the SFT how such an initiative could work in reality and how it would fit in alongside its ongoing work".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schoolmeals"&gt;School meals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/oliver"&gt;Jamie Oliver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink"&gt;Food &amp; drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/chefs"&gt;Chefs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/health"&gt;Health policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/deniscampbell"&gt;Denis Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Paul and Rachel Chandler, seized after leaving the Seychelles bound for Tanzania in October 2009, told a committee of MPs  that the Foreign Office did not have the "expertise" to deal with kidnappings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Chandler, 61, said it had only contacted their family "four days after the news was in the public domain". By that time relatives were "bewildered, uncertain, and unadvised", while being hounded by the media for information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office should have advised the family "at the earliest possible moment" about the general situation regarding hostages and kidnappings in Somalia. It should have advised them not to speak to the media "because it was well known that by far the best thing for a hostage is a press blackout". If their family had known that "it would perhaps have had significant beneficial consequences," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should also have told the family "we can't help you – but here's a man who can". Because of lack of political influence in Somalia, and British government policy not to pay ransoms, Chandler said the family should have been told: "If you need help, the private sector can help. Perhaps you should contact these people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was more appropriate for police to take the lead in such situations, he said, as they had expertise in criminal kidnappings. "We were just the hostages, but our families were the victim of extortion." The couple were giving evidence at the foreign affairs committee inquiry into piracy off Somalia. Most of their evidence was given in private for the sake of Judith Tebbutt, who is still being held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple, originally from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, but now living in Dartmouth, Devon, were released last November  for an unconfirmed ransom of up to £620,000. Rachel Chandler, 57, said: "What the Foreign Office did provide was essentially tea and sympathy. And in doing so, I think, it rubbed our family up the wrong way." The couple's suspected captors are  being tried in Kenya over the hijacking of a French vessel. The Chandlers said they understood the British and Kenyan authorities are discussing whether they will also face trial over their case. The Metropolitan police is said to have handed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd like to see them prosecuted by the UK. Not necessarily physically in the UK,''  said Paul Chandler, "and yes, we would be happy to give evidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple said there had been no warnings, from the Foreign Office, their insurers or the authorities  in the Seychelles that their route to  Tanzania would put them at high risk from piracy. Rachel Chandler added they would continue sailing: "Cruising is our chosen lifestyle and we want to continue cruising for as long as we are able. We're certainly not defeated by what happened to us".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/piracy"&gt;Piracy at sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy"&gt;Foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/carolinedavies"&gt;Caroline Davies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But even where police identified gang members being present, most forces believe they did not play a pivotal role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding by senior Whitehall officials is a blow to the principal response to the riots being pushed strongly by the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith – that tackling gang culture is key to preventing any repeat of the .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and Home Office background analysis shows that those arrested during the riots mainly came from deprived areas and had the poorest educational backgrounds. More than two thirds of the young people involved were classed as having special educational needs and one third had been excluded from school in the past year. More than 42% received free school meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the ethnic backgrounds of those brought before the courts for riot-related offences varied significantly from the local population, with 42% of defendants white and 46% black. Only 7% were Asian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ethnic composition of court defendants was particularly different from the local area profile in three places: Haringey in north London, where 55% of defendants were black compared with 17% of young people locally; Nottingham, where 62% of defendants were black compared with 9% locally; and Birmingham, where 46% of defendants were black compared with 9% of young people locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Home Office figures were based on 5,175 crimes recorded across 19 police forces – the vast majority in London, Manchester and Birmingham. More than 40% happened in town or city centres and 20% in shopping malls or other "defined retail cores". Half the crimes were committed against commercial premises. A total of 2,584 shops and other commercial premises were targeted in the riots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MoJ figures confirm that 90% of those arrested in the riots were male. More than half were under 20. They also confirm the more punitive nature of the courts, with 42% of those tried in magistrates courts sent to prison, compared with only 12% normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of arrests says that 13% or 417 individuals were identified as being affiliated to a gang by the 10 police forces who suffered the most extensive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outside London, the majority of forces identified fewer than 10% of all arrestees as gang members, and only two non-London forces estimated figures in excess of this – West Yorkshire (19%) and Nottinghamshire (17%). For these two forces, these percentages only represent relatively small numbers of arrestees (13 and 20 respectively)," says the Home Office report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In London, police reported that 19% of arrestees – 337 suspects drawn from 169 different gangs – were identified as gang members," the report adds. "However, even in London, the great majority of arrestees (81%) were not identified as being members of gangs." Home Office statisticians acknowledge that the way the 10 different forces identified gang members was not completely consistent but add: "Most forces perceived that where gangs were involved, they generally did not play a pivotal role."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report says some incidents suggested "orchestrated offending related to gang activity", but stresses that clear examples of this were "few in number". They included targeting high-value property in Manchester and "diversion tactics". Gang members were also involved in a handful of more serious incidents including the shooting incident in Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis contrasts sharply with the picture presented to the Conservative party conference by Duncan Smith, when he said gangs played "a significant part" in the riots. An anti-riots tsar, Louise Casey, has been appointed to lead the drive against gang culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the MoJ analysis stresses the poor educational and socio-economic background of those arrested in the riots. "It is clear that compared to population averages, those brought before the courts were more likely to be in receipt of free school meals or benefits, were more likely to have had special educational needs and be absent from school, and are more likely to have some form of criminal history. This pattern held across all areas looked at," it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london-riots"&gt;UK riots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gangs"&gt;Gangs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/communities"&gt;Communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/youngpeople"&gt;Young people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/manchester"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/nottingham"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/birmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alantravis"&gt;Alan Travis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"Right now, we are facing a race against time to provide shelter for people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday's 7.2-magnitude quake had the most severe effect in Ercis, a town of around 75,000 people, where an estimated 80  buildings collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provincial capital, Van, about 60 miles to the south, experienced substantial damage as well, and the situation was bad in many surrounding villages. According to the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who toured the region by helicopter, virtually all mud-brick homes had collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told a late-night press conference in Van: "Because the buildings are made of mud-brick, they are more vulnerable to quakes. I must say that almost all buildings in such villages are destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He returned to Ankara to chair a cabinet meeting about the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While death tolls given by government ministers varied, the number of dead is likely to rise substantially as bodies are removed from the rubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rescue teams used diggers and cranes to remove bigger pieces of debris before going through wreckage using picks, bars and their bare hands to find survivors, working through the night under floodlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One report said 24 people had been pulled from rubble alive in two hours during the first morning after the quake. While this slowed, there were still successes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rescuers were often led to survivors via mobile phone calls. A man, Yalcin Akay, was saved from a collapsed six-storey building in Ercis after he called an emergency line and described his location, the Anatolia news agency reported. Three others, including two children, were also rescued from the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witnesses watched a woman and her daughter being painstakingly released from beneath a concrete slab. "I'm here, I'm here," the woman called to rescuers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others had to wait and hope. One woman at another building in Ercis said she had spoken to a fellow teacher six hours after the quake. "She's my friend, and she called me to say that she's alive and she's stuck in the rubble near the stairs of the building," she said. "She told me she was wearing red pyjamas." One particularly urgent search was centred on a collapsed student dormitory in Ercis. "University students are said to be living here," Mustafa Bilgin, a mine rescue expert, said. "We don't know how many of them are still inside – we've reached their computers, clothing, but we did not see anyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite worries about the ease with which so many tall buildings collapsed – poor construction standards have been blamed for the high death tolls in previous quakes in Turkey – the interior minister, Idris Naim Sahin, said the final tally may be lower than initially feared. "There could be around 100 people [still in the rubble]. It could be more or it could be less," he said. "But we are not talking about thousands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red Crescent has set up tented relief camps in two stadiums in Ercis, also distributing tents to those who prefer to remain near their homes. It was also handing out supplies such as blankets, sleeping bags and heaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another task, Erskoy said, was providing emotional support for the bereaved or those waiting to hear about the missing. "This is very difficult work," he said. "We're working with psychologists to provide the best support that we can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some significant relief efforts were being organised via social media such as Twitter and Facebook. Erhan Çelik, a journalist for Turkey's Kanal 7 TV station, passed to his 22,000 Twitter followers an appeal for people to offer accommodation to those made homeless. Within a few hours, he said, he had received 17,000 emails in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a darker side. Van province has a majority Kurdish population and is a centre of support for the banned separatist Kurdish Workers' party (PKK).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Turkish TV host triggered protests&amp;nbsp;after asking why Kurds who sometimes battled the police should expect help from officers. Çelik said he had received abusive replies after tweeting condolences in Kurdish as well as Turkish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of countries have offered assistance with both relief aid and search and rescue efforts.

If the blockade is not borne down by the end of the year the organisation cannot continue its work," Assange told a news conference in central London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement is the most open acknowledgement of the site's perilous financial situation since a clutch of financial operators blocked donations in the days after its publication of leaked US embassy cables in November last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paypal, Visa, MasterCard, Bank of America, Western Union and Post Finance cut financial ties following the release, through the Guardian and other media partners, while Every DNS withdrew its domain hosting service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website has begun "pre-litigation action" in Britain, Iceland, Denmark, Belgium, the United States and Australia against the blockade, said Assange, and an action pressing the European competition authorities to investigate the "wrongdoing of Visa and MasterCard" is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assange said the financial companies had bowed to pressure from "a political grouping in the US" to block payments to the site, while the US treasury, among other organisations, had found no grounds for the blockade. "The most powerful players in the banking industry have been shown to be an arm of rightwing America," he said, adding: "A handful of US financial companies cannot be allowed to decide how the whole world votes with its pocket."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donations had slumped from a monthly average of €100,000 (£87,000) at the end of 2010 to an average of €6-7,000 during 2010. Based on the rate of donations on the day the blockade was imposed, WikiLeaks argues it has been deprived of between €40m and €50m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assange, 40, remains on bail pending a ruling on his appeal against extradition to Sweden to answer allegations of rape and sexual assault. Asked about his own legal fees in that case, he said: "WikiLeaks collected monies have never gone to the Swedish case to which I am subject." He is soliciting donations towards his personal legal fees, but through separate accounts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website needs $3.5m (£2.2m) to get through the next 12 months, Assange said. "Unusually for a hi-tech organisation," he said, "it is now accepting cheques and cash sent in the post as well as donations via more modern means such as by text message." A new fundraising page on the WikiLeaks website urges supporters to use bank transfers, post cash or cheques or buy "revenue-generating gifts" – WikiLeaks- or Assange-branded merchandise including T-shirts and wallets and "dog bandanas" – to raise money. A number of smaller online suppliers including BitCoin and Flattr will process WikiLeaks donations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assange acknowledged, however, that the organisation would also need to recruit "a constellation of wealthy individuals from different nations" to help it to meet legal and publishing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/24/bankers-wikileaks-free-speech?INTCMP=SRCH" title=" The bankers' blockade of WikiLeaks must end"&gt;• James Ball on why the bankers' blockade of WikiLeaks must end&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/wikileaks"&gt;WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/julian-assange"&gt;Julian Assange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/estheraddley"&gt;Esther Addley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"It is painful that despite significant investment in the Vietnamese rhino population, conservation efforts failed to save this unique animal. Vietnam has lost part of its natural heritage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://eol.org/pages/328342/overview" title=""&gt;Javan rhinoceros (&lt;em&gt;Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticusare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) was  believed to be extinct in mainland Asia until an individual was killed by hunters in  Vietnam's Cat Tien region in 1988, leading to the discovery of a small population that by 2007 numbered just eight. From the mid-1990s, a number of organisations worked to set up habitat protection programmes to safeguard the rhino and its food sources, leading to the establishment of a national park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even within a protected area, it has proved extremely difficult to defend the species from illegal hunting. In April 2010, local people reported the discovery of a rhino carcass. A forest patrol team was immediately deployed to the site where they confirmed the dead animal was a Javan rhino. It had a bullet in its leg and its horn had been removed. Rhinos are poached for their horn, which is a highly prized ingredient in traditional medicines, and has recently been lauded as a cure for cancer, despite there being no scientific evidence to support this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2009 and 2010, in an effort to determine the exact Javan rhinoceros population status in Cat Tien, WWF conducted a field survey, using highly trained sniffer dogs from the US to locate rhino dung samples. The results of DNA analysis conducted on the samples, published today in a new WWF report, have confirmed that all of the dung collected in the park belonged to the same rhino, which was found dead shortly after the survey was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reintroduction of the rhinoceros to Vietnam is not economically or practically feasible. It is gone from Vietnam forever," said Christy Williams, WWF's Asian elephant and rhino programme co-ordinator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Javan rhinoceros is now believed to be confined to one population, comprising less than 50 individuals,  on the island of Java. The species was once was found on  Indonesia, and throughout south-east Asia– including India and China, but increasing pressure on its rainforest habitat has put a question mark over the future of the species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This makes our work in Indonesia even more critical. We must ensure that what happened to the Javan rhinoceros in Vietnam is not repeated in Indonesia a few years down the line," said Susie Ellis of the International Rhino Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illegal hunting to supply the wildlife trade has reduced many species in Vietnam to small and isolated populations. The Indochinese tiger, Asian elephant and endemic species like the saola, Tonkin snub-nosed monkey and Siamese crocodile are on the verge of extinction in the country. Conservationists have warned that inadequate law enforcement and ineffective management of protected areas, and infrastructure development occurring within and close to Vietnam's protected areas will only exert additional pressures on already fragile populations of species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/wildlife"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/"&gt;Conservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/endangeredspecies"&gt;Endangered species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/wwf"&gt;WWF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/animals"&gt;Animals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
