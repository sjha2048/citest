        <p>
          By selecting the option below, a copy of the file will be made. This is recommended, and is equivalent to uploading
          a file from your disk. It also means that should the data behind the URL become unavailable, the data is still
          available from <%= Seek::Config.application_name %>.
          However, you should be sure that the copyright on the file allows you to do this.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you do not select the option below <%= Seek::Config.application_name %> will store only the URL and a copy will not be stored on <%= Seek::Config.application_name %>. You should do this if the file
          is large or you always want <%= Seek::Config.application_name %> to deliver the latest version.
