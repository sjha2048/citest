  <p>
    Unfortunately, an error occurred whilst processing the uploaded <%= t('data_file') %>. The error has been logged and reported.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can still continue to register the <%= t('data_file') %>, but any details will need to be manually, rather than automatically, completed.
    This will only affect you if the <%= t('data_file') %> uploaded was a RightField based template.
