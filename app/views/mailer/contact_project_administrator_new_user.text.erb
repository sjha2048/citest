Hi,

The new user <%= @person.name %> just signed up and indicated that they are a member of the following projects and/or institutions:

<%= @details %>

If you know this person is a genuine member of a <%= t('project').downcase %> you administer, you can add them by:
    - following the link to the <%= t('project').downcase %> shown below
    - select the Administration menu
    - select the Administer <%= t('project') %> members button

Links to these <%= t('project').pluralize.downcase %> are:

<% @projects.each do |project| %>
    <%= project.title %> - <%= project_url(project) %>
<% end %>

<% unless @other_institutions.blank? %>
New institutions have been suggested - <%=@other_institutions%>. First double check if they exist, and if not you can create them.
You can do this by selecting to create a new institution from the Create menu at the top.

After the institution has been created successfully, you need to assign it to the <%= t('project').downcase %> following the steps described above.

<% end %>
More details about adding people to projects can be found at <%= Seek::Help::HelpDictionary.instance.help_link(:admin_project_members) %>

If you need to contact the person, their details can be found at: <%= person_url(@person) %>, and their email address is <%= @person.email %> .
