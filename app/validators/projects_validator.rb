# This validator is to ensure resources are only connected to appropriate projects.
# "Appropriate projects" in this case, is the current user's projects + the original contributor's projects.
#
# It operates in two modes:
# 1. Validating a record's association is part of a related project.
#    For example, when creating a Study, making sure the Study's investigation is owned by ONE OF the current user's projects.
#
#         validates :investigation, projects: true
#
# 2. Validating a record's project associations directly.
#    For example, when creating an Investigation, making sure ALL Investigation's projects involve the current user.
#
#         validates :projects, projects: { self: true }
#
#    Note: In this mode, on update, only the NEWLY ADDED projects are validated
