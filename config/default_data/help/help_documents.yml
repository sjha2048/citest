    - Metadata Guidelines
    - "h1. Minimum Metadata Guidelines for the SysMO SEEK\r\n\r\nThe more metadata
      you provide for your assets in the SEEK, the easier it is to find them and to
      compare them with other assets. If you provide assets with very little metadata,
      these will also be displayed (in accordance with access control policies set
      by you), but they may be hard to interpret for other people.\r\n\r\nIn addition
      to SEEK data sharing guidelines, some types of data have minimum metadata requirements
      for publication, for example, microarray data must be MIAME compliant. Following
      the guidelines for SEEK metadata should ensure that when you come to publish,
      you have already met these requirements. \r\nThese guidelines outline what we
      require for SEEK.\r\n\r\nh2. General SEEK Metadata\r\n\r\n*Name* (of the data
      uploader). This is the person responsible for the data and responsible for setting
      sharing and dissemination policies. If more than one person was involved in
      the experiment, you can credit these people separately \r\n*SEEK ID* - (Of the
      above person). This helps us identify each person within SEEK. \r\n*Project*
      - The name of the project that the asset relates to. If your data is being uploaded
      by a JERM harvester, we will know which project it belongs to, but if you are
      uploading directly to SEEK and you are in more than one SysMO project, it is
      important to specify. Typically, an asset will belong to only one project.\r\n*Upload
      Date (yymmdd)*. This is the date of publication to SEEK rather than the date
      of the experiment. Depending on the system your project uses, we will try to
      automatically detect when changes are made to a file. Each upload will automatically
      receive its own timestamp when uploaded directly into SEEK\r\n*Experiment Date
      (yymmdd)*. This is the date the experiment was performed\r\n*Title* - a unique
      name for your asset file. If you upload manually, you will receive an error
      message if the file title is not unique within your project. If your asset is
      uploaded via a JERM Harvester without a title, you will receive an email notification.\r\n*Version
      Number* - If your file replaces an existing file, the version number will help
      us pick this up. Keep it simple, versions should go up by integers.\r\n*Names
      of other people involved* - many experiments involve multiple steps and multiple
      people. This metadata field allows you to give credit and attribution to all
      those involved\r\n\r\nh2. ISA Infrastructure\r\n\r\nh3. Investigation\r\n\r\n*Title*
      - described above. All assets should have a title\r\n*Description* - free text
      describing the purpose of the investigation\r\n*Project* - as described above.
      All assets should be associated with a project\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Study\r\n\r\n*Title*
      - as described above. All assets should have a title\r\n*Description* - free
      text describing the purpose of the study\r\n*Person Responsible* - the contributor
      of the study description\r\n*Experimentalists* - other scientists involved in
      any of the work in the study. If they are in SysMO, please give their SEEK ID,
      so we can link to their profiles in SEEK. If they are not in SEEK, their names
      will still be displayed, but not linked. Peopleâ€™s involvement can also be
      inferred from anyone named in included assays.\r\n*Project* - as described above.
      All assets should be associated with a project\r\n*Investigation title* - The
      name of the investigation the study belongs to. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Assay\r\n\r\n*Assay
      Title* - The name of the assay that the asset links to. \r\n*Assay type* - The
      controlled vocabulary term describing the assay classification\r\nIf you cannot
      find a suitable Assay Type term, please contact us or your PAL to update the
      vocabulary \r\n*Technology type* - The controlled vocabulary term describing
      the technology used in the assay\r\nIf you cannot find a suitable Technology
      Type term, please contact us or your PAL to update the vocabulary \r\n*Study
      title* - The name of the study the assay belongs to. An assay can belong to
      more than one study\r\n*Organism* The name of the organism being studied with
      this asset. If uploading through SEEK, organism names are provided as a drop-down
      list\r\n*Strain* The name of the particular strain being studied\r\n*WT/Mutant*
      - Specifies whether this strain is wild-type or mutant\r\n*Genotype* - a brief
      text description of the genotype\r\n*Phenotype* - a brief text description of
      the phenotype\r\n*Culture Growth* - This describes how the culture was grown
      for this assay. You can choose values from a drop-down list when adding new
      assays directly to SEEK\r\n*Data File Titles* - the title of one or many data
      files produced during this assay\r\n*SOP Titles* - the title of one or many
      SOPs used to execute this assay\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. SysMO Assets\r\n\r\nh3. Data\r\n\r\n*Title*
      - as described above\r\n*Description* - free text to describe what the data
      is showing\r\n*File Format* - how the data is stored, for example excel spreadsheet\r\n*Factors
      Studied* - what experimental parameters did you alter in order to study the
      effects in the organism (e.g. changing the pH from 5 to 7)\r\n*Measured Item*
      - what was measured in this data, e.g. concentration of glucose. Measured items
      should be named using controlled vocabulary terms wherever possible, for example,
      glucose has chEBI name glucose and chEBI ID CHEBI:17234\r\n*Units* - how the
      measurements were taken, e.g. concentration in mmol, or mass in grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
      Models \r\n\r\n*Filename/archive name* - the title of the asset\r\n*Description*
      - free text to describe what the model is showing\r\n*Model Type* - what kind
      of mathematical equations does your model contain e.g. ODE, algebraic\r\n*Model
      Format* - e.g. SBML, CellML. If uploading directly through SEEK, you will be
      able to chose from a drop-down list\r\n*Model Execution Environment and URL*
      - how do you run a simulation on your model? This field should provide a link
      to a tool or resource which would allow you to run your model\r\n*Linking Models
      to Data* - this section allows you to specify how and where data files were
      used to a) construct your model b) validate your model, or c) record simulation
      results from your model. If you are uploading directly through SEEK, you can
      find the relevant files by searching a drop-down list. If uploading through
      a JERM Harvester, you should use the data file title or SEEKID \r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
      SOPs\r\n\r\n*Title* - as described above. All assets should have a title\r\n*Description*
      - free text to describe what the SOP is used for\r\n*Experimental conditions*
      - what was standardised and fixed in this experiment (e.g. concentration of
      nutrients, pH, temperature). If you are uploading directly through SEEK, you
      can chose from a drop-down list\r\n*Units*  -  how the measurements were taken
      e.g. concentration in mmol or mass in grams.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Publications\r\n\r\n*PubmedID
      or DOI* - the SEEK can extract publication abstracts from PubMed, when supplied
      with a PubmedID. When the paper abstract is retrieved, you can verify which
      people from a drop-down list are authors from within the consortium, so that
      we can link to their profile\r\nCurrently, publications are linked to people
      and projects. In the next version, publications will be linked to other SysMO
      assets to allow you to use the SEEK as a supplementary data store\r\n\r\n\r\n*Attribution*
      - Some assets are based on others, for example, a model may use data from an
      experimental assay, or a SOP may be a modified version of another. The attribution
      section allows you to specify when this is the case\r\n"

    - Transcriptomics Guidelines
    - "h1. Transcriptomics: Guidelines for SysMO Templates\r\n\r\nThe MIAME standard
      and the associated MAGE-ML format are well established in the transcriptomics
      community and adherence to MAGE-ML is becoming increasingly important for publishing
      data. \r\n\r\nMAGE-TAB is a tab delimited representation of MAGE-ML. It allows
      users to construct MIAME compliant excel spreadsheets. The ISA-TAB specification
      also allows an export to MAGE-TAB format.\r\n\r\nFor SysMO-DB, we recommend
      you use MAGE-TAB templates for transcriptomics data. We have a JERM mapping
      for MAGE-TAB, so as long as you do not change the headers and titles of worksheets,
      we can extract your data in this format.\r\n\r\nThere are several parts to a
      MAGE-TAB file. These parts can be represented as separate files, or separate
      worksheets in excel. MAGE-TAB consists of:\r\n\r\n*IDF - Investigation Description
      Format*\r\nThis worksheet is an overview of the experiment, factors studied,
      protocols, publication information and contact details.\r\n\r\n*SDRF - Sample
      and Data Relationship Format*\r\nThis worksheet details the links between sample
      and data, it can include information about the source (e.g. organism rat), the
      sample (e.g. rat liver), extracts (e.g. total RNA), labelled extract (e.g. synthetic
      DNA), hybridisations (e.g. a reference on the Array as defined by the ADF),
      raw data (e.g. a reference to a raw data file), normalisation (e.g. a reference
      to normalised data file), derived array data files (e.g. a reference to a derived
      data file, or file matrix)\r\n\r\n*Raw Data and Processed Data*\r\nThese worksheets
      hold the actual and derived data values\r\n\r\n*ADF - Array Design Format (optional)*\r\nThis
      worksheet provides the array-level annotation for the experiment, relating the
      row-level identifiers in the data files to biological sequence annotation.\r\n\r\nThere
      are a detailed \"set of help pages and examples provided by the MGED community\":http://tab2mage.sourceforge.net/docs/magetab_docs.html\r\n\r\nThere
      are also tools to help you construct MAGE-TAB templates on the web. For example,
      there is the \"ArrayExpress submission help system\":http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/microarray/magetab.cgi
      and there is the \"ISA curator tool from the ISA-TAB group\":http://isatab.sourceforge.net/isacreator.html\r\n\r\nh2.
      Notes and additions for SysMO\r\n\r\nh3. IDF\r\n\r\nMany of the personal details
      in the IDF sheet can be automatically extracted from your SysMO SEEK profile.
      If you add your SEEK ID as an additional field (called SEEK ID), we can extract
      all your personal details from your profile so there is no need to complete
      these personal details fields. \r\nSimilarly, you can refer to protocols (SOPs
      in SEEK) by their SEEK ID, and we can automatically extract their name and brief
      description.\r\nThis worksheet also contains fields to link to publications.
      In many cases, data could be shared in SEEK before publication. If so, please
      leave these fields blank, but do not remove them.\r\n\r\nh3. SDRF\r\n\r\nThis
      file links the sample and source information to the data files and their locations.\r\nThe
      â€œprotocolâ€\x9D columns will normally be followed by â€œfactor valueâ€\x9D
      columns. Again, we can extract these from the experimental conditions and factors
      studies sections of SEEK where you are referring to a SOP already submitted.
      \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Raw Data and Processed Data\r\n\r\nh5. Raw Data\r\n\r\nWe do
      not necessarily expect you to share raw data within SEEK by default, but links
      to this upon request are essential. The MAGE-TAB specification supports many
      different types of raw data format. For a complete list, please see \"here\":http://tab2mage.sourceforge.net/docs/datafiles.html\r\n\r\nh5.
      Processed Data\r\n\r\nIf your processed data maps to the identifier in your
      array design, you can create a single results file with column 1 being those
      identifiers with the heading â€œReporter Identifierâ€\x9D followed by the quantitation
      columns with the quantitation types as the headings and the column of data values.
      Additionally, you may want to add columns for a name and/or description of identifier,
      but this is optional\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. ADF\r\n\r\nThis worksheet is necessary when
      submitting your array data to a public repository, but it is optional for SEEK.
      It is a physical description of the array. Many commercial and academic array
      designs have already been submitted to ArrayExpress, so you could simply reference
      your design from ArrayExpress. Affymetrix, Agilent, Illumina, Nimblegen and
      Sanger array designs have already been submitted and can be explored \"here\":http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/aer/entry\r\n"

    - Frequently Asked Questions
    - "h6. What is the SysMO-SEEK? \r\n\r\nThe SEEK is a catalogue of assets held
      by the SysMO consortium. You can use the SEEK searching interface to find Data,
      Models, SOPs and protocols. You can also use it to find people, their institutions
      and their expertise\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. What is the Yellow Page?\r\n\r\nA directory
      of all the current and past members of the SysMO consortium, their project associates,
      their institutions and their expertise and experience\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. Are the
      SysMO Assets (Data, Models, and SOPs) kept in SEEK?\r\n\r\nNot normally. SEEK
      links to the repositories of each SysMO project, so it is a catalogue of what
      is available rather than a repository. You can, however, upload files if you
      wish.\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. What kind of models can I store/link to?\r\n\r\nSEEK can
      handle models in any format, but we recommend that you use SBML. JWS Online
      simulations can also be run from SEEK for models in SBML\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. What
      format should SOPs be in?\r\n\r\nYou can upload SOPs in any format, but we recommend
      you use the â€œNature Protocolsâ€\x9D format. A template is available for download
      from SEEK. In the future, we will be able to extract extra information from
      this format to help with the searching\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. Can I delete things from
      SEEK?\r\n\r\nYes, you can delete any assets owned by you (i.e. any items that
      show you as the uploader). If they are associated with other assets, you will
      first have to remove the associations, otherwise the asset wonâ€™t be properly
      deleted, but deprecated.\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. What is the Investigations Tab for?\r\n\r\nInvestigations
      are high level descriptions of the research carried out by a particular SysMO
      project. They typically reflect the general aims of the project, for example,
      carbon metabolism or anaerobic/aerobic transitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. What is the
      Studies Tab for?\r\n\r\nA study is a series of experiments (or assays) which
      can be combined to answer a particular biological question. These experiments
      might be a series of the same type of assay (for example, microarrays for different
      conditions), or they may be a collection of different types of assay (e.g. a
      combination of array and mass spec measurements).\r\n\r\n\r\nh6. What is the
      Assay Tab for?\r\n\r\nAn assay describes a particular experiment. It allows
      you to associate data files, SOPs and models together as well as describing
      the type of assay and any technology required to perform the experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nh6.
      Can I change or add information to SEEK assets after they are uploaded?\r\n\r\nYes,
      if you have permission, you can edit any asset. You will automatically have
      permission to change anything you own and other people in your project might
      also give you permission to edit their assets. \r\n\r\nh6. Can I see all the
      assets on SEEK?\r\n\r\nNo. All assets can be shared with specific individuals
      or groups, so some things will be not be public and hidden from view. In some
      cases, you might be able to see a description of an asset (the asset metadata),
      but not be able to download it. In these situations, you will be able to send
      a request to the owner to ask for their permission to download the asset.\r\n\r\n\r\nh6.
      What is metadata?\r\n\r\nMetadata is a description of the data and where it
      originates (it is data about the data). For example, metadata about a model
      would include; who produced it, what project was it associated with, what format
      it was in, what type of model etc."

      h1. Proteomics: Suggestions for SysMO Templates

      The MIAPE standard (Minimum Information About a Proteomics Experiment) follows the same principles as the longer established MIAME standard for transcriptomics. It is a set of guidelines describing the minimum information required to adequately record a proteomics experiment (i.e. where the samples came from, how they were analysed and what equipment was used etc) to allow others to understand and potentially reuse data.

      There is growing interest in the MIAPE standard from publishers, and some journals now require MAIPE compliant data in order to publish. This is not yet as widespread as the requirement for MIAME compliance in transcriptomics, but it is still increasing.

      For SysMO-SEEK, we recommend you adopt a MIAPE compliant data template where possible.

      Proteomics experiments vary widely and cover many different techniques. MIAPE is therefore a collection of reporting guidelines for the different technologies available. Examples include:

      * Reporting guidelines for molecular interaction experiments (MIMIx)
      * Reporting guidelines for Mass Spectrometry experiments
      * Reporting guidelines for Mass Spectrometry Informatics experiments
      * Reporting guidelines for Gel Electrophoresis experiments
      * Reporting guidelines for Column Chromatography
      * Reporting guidelines for Capillary Electrophoresis
      * Reporting guidelines for gel image informatics (under development)

      The associated examples are templates for Mass Spectrometry experiments. These have been developed by the Pride PRoteomics IDEntifications database and more details can be found on "their website":http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/

      Embedded in the spreadsheet are some macros that will help you annotate your data with terms from controlled vocabularies where appropriate.

      RightField\r\n\r\nRightField (http://www.rightfield.org.uk) allows the easy
      annotation of excel spreadsheet data with terms from community ontologies. Relevant
      ranges of ontology terms can be embedded into spreadsheets in specific cells
      as simple drop-down lists. This allows consistent and standards-compliant annotation
      without the need to browse or navigate the ontologies. \r\nMultiple ontologies
      can be used in the same spreadsheet, and the sources of each term and the version
      of each ontology is automatically collected and recorded. \r\nA collection of
      SysMO templates have already been RightField-enabled. These templates are available
      for download from the templates page and from the SysMO-DB project in the SEEK.\r\n\r\nh3.
      JWS OneStop\r\n\r\nOneStop assists with model annotation and publishing. It
      is a one-stop-shop for producing a MIRIAM-compliant, annotated model in SBML.
      OneStop extracts the names used for species and reactions in an uploaded model
      and uses these names to search public databases for the official terms and MIRIAM
      identifiers. It uses the Semantic SBML web service (http://semanticsbml.org/)
      for searching and returns a list of possible matches that the modellers can
      select from. This ensures the accuracy of each annotation whilst providing an
      easy mechanism for identifying possible matches. \r\nIn addition to annotations,
      OneStop also provides editing and validation functionality as well as automatically
      exporting models in SBGN.\r\n\r\n"

    - ISA Best Practice
    - "h1. ISA Best Practice Guide\r\n\r\nThe ISA Infrastructure (Investigation, Study,
      Assay) is a general purpose framework for describing how experiments relate
      to one another. It describes both metadata (samples, characteristics, technologies,
      etc) and data (transcriptomics, proteomics etc), but the data itself is stored
      separately, and can therefore be as public or private as required. The ISA descriptions
      are visible to the rest of the SysMO consortium.\r\nThe original purpose of
      the ISA infrastructure was to provide a common framework for relating multiple
      omics data and to provide a single mechanism for submission to omics data silos
      (such as ArrayExpress for Microarray data, or PRIDE, for proteomics data). SysMO
      data often involves omics data and generally relies on the integration of multiple
      data types, so the ISA infrastructure will provide a mechanism for SysMO data
      export as well as providing a common framework for navigation. \r\nFor more
      information on the ISA community work, please see: \r\n\"http://isatab.sourceforge.net/index.html\":http://isatab.sourceforge.net/index.html\r\n\r\nh2.
      Examples\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to describe your projects and the relationships
      between the different work-packages and research topics. The following guidelines
      provide a general description of the ISA Infrastructure and examples of how
      this may fit with your SysMO project. We use examples from the Bioinvestigation
      Index (BII \"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioinvindex/\":http://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioinvindex/),
      which is a public database of ISA compliant data. We also use examples already
      available in SysMO\r\n\r\n* *Investigation:* a high level description of the

    - A Quick Guide to Using the ISA Structure
    - "h1. A Quick Guide to Using ISA in SEEK\r\n\r\nISA stands for Investigations,
      Studies and Assays. It is the structure developed by the ISA-TAB community (http://isacommons.org/)
      and adopted by the SEEK to help you describe your data, experiments and models.\r\nIn
      SEEK, you can upload or link to any data, models or protocols from your projects,
      but they don't normally exist in isolation. ISA provides a framework for expressing
      how the work in your projects fits together. For example, you may have transcriptomics,
      proteomics and metabolomics data which was all created to address the same biological
      problem. \r\nISA also allows you to associate your data to the SOPs that were
      used to create them. For models, it allows linkage to construction or validation
      data sets. This makes it easier for others to interpret your results, or to
      repeat or validate your results when required. \r\nThe aim of using the ISA
      structure is to ensure a complete record of the experiment and associated assets
      is available and accessible to other project members in a standard format.\r\n\r\nh2.
      Investigations, Studies and Assays Defined\r\n\r\nThe following describes the
      purpose of each 'layer' in the structure, using examples from SysMO, and also
      from the public BioInvestigation Index database(BII http://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioinvindex/),
      which also uses the ISA structure for managing data\r\n\r\n* *Investigation:*
      a high level description of the overall area of research. In SysMO, this may
      be the overall aims of the project, as stated on the sysmo.net website. If your
      project has several subprojects that do not share any data, you should define
      an investigation for each.\r\n\r\n* BII Example: Growth control of the eukaryote
      cell: a systems biology study in yeast\r\n* SysMO Example: Analysis of Central
      Carbon Metabolism of Sulfolobus solfataricus under varying temperatures\r\n\r\n*
      *Study:* a particular biological hypothesis, which you are planning to test
      in various ways, using various techniques, which could be experimental, informatics,
      modelling, or a mixture\r\n* BII Example: Study of the impact of changes in
      flux on the transcriptome, proteome, endometabolome and exometabolome of the
      yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under different nutrient limitations\r\n* SysMO
      Example: Comparison of S. solfataricus grown at 70 and 80 degrees\r\n\r\n* *Assay:*
      specific, individual experiments, measurements, or modelling tasks\r\nIn SysMO,
      this may be a microarray experiment, or a flux balance analysis, for example\r\n*
      BII Example: \r\nTranscriptional profiling\r\nDNA Microarray\r\n* SysMO Example:
      \r\nComparison of transcriptome 70 and 80c (Cdna microarray)\r\nComparison of
      proteome at 70 and 80c (Protein expression profiling)\r\nIntracellular metabolomics
      of s. solfataricus at 70 and 80c (Metabolomics)\r\n\r\nh2. Viewing Associations
      Between SEEK Assets\r\n\r\nIn SEEK, the ISA structure is displayed graphically,
      so you can see at a glance what items are associated with one another \r\n \r\n!/help_images/0000/0001/ISAUpperLevel.png!\r\n\r\nThe
      figure above shows the Investigation Glycerol Synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      has one study, which in turn contains three different assays. If we zoom in
      on one particular assay, the Glycerol Synthesis Model Construction, we can see
      the SEEK downloadable assets it is associated with.\r\n\r\n!/help_images/0000/0003/ISADataModel.png!\r\n
      \r\nIn this case, the Assay is not a laboratory experiment, but a modelling
      task. Referring to it as an assay is therefore confusing, so we call these Modelling
      Analyses instead of Assays. This modelling analysis has a publication and a
      model associated with it, as well as a data file that was used for model validation.
      The data file is also associated with another assay (Intracellular Metabolites).
      This assay describes how the validation data was originally produced. As you
      can see, it is possible to associate data files, models, and other SEEK assets
      with more than one assay if necessary. \r\n\r\nh2. Using ISA when Uploading
      SEEK Assets\r\n\r\nYou can link assets to ISA descriptions, or vice versa, so
      it doesn't matter which you do first. Many projects prefer to have a higher
      level structure of Investigations and Studies defined from the beginning, so
      that new experiments can be linked up with little work for the uploader.\r\n\r\nh2.
      Starting with your Data\r\n\r\nWe recommend using a JERM template to describe
      your data wherever available. We have a list of templates available here: https://seek.sysmo-db.org/help/templates
      \r\nIf there is not a specific template for your type of data, consider using
      the general JERM master template. This template contains all the required JERM
      metadata elements, but not necessarily any technology-specific extensions. If
      you use and extend the JERM master for a particular type of experiment, please
      consider contributing those changes back to the consortium. Other people may
      wish to use your new template.\r\nIf you have your data in any other format,
      you can still upload it to SEEK, but indexing will be limited, so subsequent
      searches will also be limited.\r\n\r\nWhen uploading your data, you will be
      asked wish assay(s) it is associated with. If you have already described the
      assay in the SEEK, you can find it from the drop-down list and link it, if you
      have not yet described your assay, you can leave this step out for the time-being.
      If your data is JERM compliant, many of the metadata elements in the upload
      form are the same as those in the first JERM metadata sheet. Soon, these elements
      will be automatically populated from your file, but for now, you will be asked
      to specify them in the web interface.\r\nOnce you have uploaded your data, you
      can create a new assay if necessary and link it back to your data. New assays
      can be associated with pre-existing Studies and Investigations, or new ones
      can be created as required. \r\nIf you upload data without linking it to the
      ISA structure, you won't be able to link it to models or SOPs. You will receive
      a warning email for these orphan  data files after they remain unlinked for
      more than 3 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
